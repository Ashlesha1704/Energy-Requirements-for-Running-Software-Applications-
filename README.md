Green Pulse is a web-based system developed to monitor and control energy usage on PCs, mobile devices, and AI models in real time.
It tracks vital system metrics like CPU usage, memory load, execution time, and energy consumption to help users understand their deviceâ€™s power behavior.
The system supports both predefined AI models(ANN, CNN, RNN) and user-uploaded models,offering energy analytics and performance                                                                                 insights for each.
Interactive controls such as brightness adjustment,dark mode, and power-saving modes are included to reduce consumption effectively.
Green Pulse aims to promote sustainable computing practices by combining performance optimization with energy awareness.
